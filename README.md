- npm or yarn

### Installation & Running

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`

## ðŸŽ¨ UX Laws Applied

### 1. **Fitts's Law**
- **Implementation**: Larger clickable areas for buttons and interactive elements
- **Purpose**: Reduces time to acquire targets, improving user efficiency
- **Examples**: 
  - Expanded hover areas for legend items and navigation buttons
  - Larger touch targets for mobile interactions

### 2. **Law of Proximity**
- **Implementation**: Related elements are grouped together with consistent spacing
- **Purpose**: Creates visual relationships and reduces cognitive load
- **Examples**:
  - Chart legends positioned near their corresponding visualizations
  - User profile information grouped in sidebar
  - Related metrics clustered in cards

### 3. **Hick's Law**
- **Implementation**: Simplified navigation with clear hierarchy
- **Purpose**: Reduces decision time by limiting choices
- **Examples**:
  - Single-level navigation in sidebar
  - Progressive disclosure in team progress section
  - Clear visual hierarchy in dashboard layout

### 4. **Miller's Rule (7Â±2)**
- **Implementation**: Limited information chunks per section
- **Purpose**: Prevents cognitive overload
- **Examples**:
  - Maximum 3 legend items per chart
  - 3 team members shown in progress section
  - Grouped dashboard sections (max 5 main areas)

### 5. **Law of Common Region**
- **Implementation**: Related elements enclosed in cards with consistent backgrounds
- **Purpose**: Creates clear boundaries and groupings
- **Examples**:
  - Each dashboard section contained in distinct cards
  - Consistent card styling and spacing
  - Visual separation between different data types

### 6. **Aesthetic-Usability Effect**
- **Implementation**: Polished visual design with smooth animations
- **Purpose**: Users perceive attractive designs as more usable
- **Examples**:
  - Smooth hover transitions and micro-interactions
  - Consistent color scheme and typography
  - Professional spacing and alignment

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Desktop**: 1024px and above (full layout)
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1023px (adapted grid)
- **Mobile**: Below 768px (stacked layout)

### Responsive Features
- Flexible grid system that adapts to screen size
- Collapsible sidebar for smaller screens
- Stacked card layout on mobile
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Optimized typography scaling

## âš¡ Performance Optimizations

- **Hardware Acceleration**: `transform-gpu` class for smooth animations
- **Efficient Animations**: CSS transforms instead of layout-triggering properties
- **Intersection Observer**: For scroll-triggered animations
- **Optimized Re-renders**: Custom hooks for hover states
- **Lazy Loading**: Components animate in when visible

### Key Technologies
- **React 18**: Latest React features and performance improvements
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- **Lucide React**: Consistent icon system
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic for animations and interactions

## ðŸŽ¯ UX Improvements Implemented

1. **Visual Feedback**: Immediate response to user interactions
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without JavaScript
3. **Accessibility**: Proper focus management and keyboard navigation
4. **Loading States**: Skeleton components for better perceived performance
5. **Error Prevention**: Clear visual cues and intuitive interactions
6. **Consistency**: Unified interaction patterns across components

## ðŸ“Š Animation Strategy

All animations follow the **12 Principles of Animation** adapted for UI:
- **Timing**: 180ms for micro-interactions, 300ms for transitions
- **Easing**: `ease-out` for natural feeling movements
- **Staging**: Staggered animations to guide attention
- **Anticipation**: Hover states prepare users for interactions
